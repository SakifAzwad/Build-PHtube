                What do you mean by REST API?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content text-white text-xl"> 
          <p>A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a way to create and interact with web services. It's like a set of rules for building web applications that communicate over the internet. Here are some key points:

            No Memory: Each time a request is made, it should include all the information needed. The server doesn't remember past requests.
            
            Client and Server: The client (e.g., your web browser) and the server (the computer serving the web page) are separate. They talk to each other over the internet.
            
            Simple Rules: REST APIs use simple rules for working with data. For example, you can use standard actions like GET (to get data), POST (to send data), PUT (to update data), and DELETE (to delete data).
            
            Resources: Everything is treated as a resource with a unique URL (web address). Think of a resource like a piece of data you want to access, like a web page or an image.
            
            Different Views: Resources can be shown in different ways. For example, you can view a web page as HTML, JSON, or XML.
            
            Easy to Scale: REST makes it easy to expand and grow your web service because of its simplicity and separation between client and server.
            
            Layers: You can add extra layers, like caching or security, between the client and server without breaking things.
            
            No Memory: The server doesn't remember past requests from the client. Each request must contain all the information needed.
            
            Caching: The server can say whether a response can be stored and reused by the client, which can speed things up.
            
            Client Control: Clients (like your web browser) can control what they want from the server. Servers don't keep track of client state.
            
            In simple terms, RESTful APIs are a set of guidelines for building web services that are easy to use and can communicate with each other over the internet. They're widely used for building websites, mobile apps, and connecting different online services. REST APIs are favored because they are straightforward and work well with the internet's foundation, HTTP.</p>
